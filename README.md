*I (George) have provided some initial strcuture of ut current project and gave my thoughts in the __[Projects](../../projects/1)__ section. Please, visit it.*

## Frontend
*Guys, I've done a simple frontend for you. There is a simple static-static version with number of HTML pages and a sinple js-containing variant which uses common menu. You will not be able to run  the latter one without setting up the web server, but you may just open __[index.html](1ikealamp/Server/static/index.html)__ and see everything work.*
