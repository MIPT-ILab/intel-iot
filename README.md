# Intel (MIPT): Internet of Things

Our ambitious project we are working over now:
## Smart Kettle

### Finally the kettle is expected to
* Fill the kettle with the water
* Boil it
* Brew the tea
* Pour the cups
* **Enjoy!**

### API:
At the most simple variant the Smart Kettle has the API as following.
**Output signals, expecting user's response:**

1. Run out of water.
2. No cups on the conveyor
3. Run out of tea
4. Other errors

**Notifications:**

1. Kettle started to boil
2. Tea is brewing...
3. The tea is ready

**Commands:**

1. Fill the kettle.
2. Boil the water.
3. Brew the tea.
4. Fill the cup.
5. Do everything at once (`make a tea!`)

![Enjoy]
